    shortDescription: Maven plugin to assemble truststores from X509 certificates stored in a Git repository
    longDescription: >
      Maven plugin to read X509 certificates from a git repository or a local directory tree and then assemble the
      certificates in environment specific truststores. The certificates to add to the truststores must be specified by
      'include' declarations. For every such declaration the certificate files in the directory {include} are added to all
      truststores while the certificate files in the directory {include}/{environment} are only added to the truststore of the
      corresponding environment.

      This plugin attempts to clone a Git repository by:

      - Using the token provided as environment variable (Default `CERTIFICATES_REPO_GIT_TOKEN`) as a personal access token
        for authentication when it is provided. This is typically used in CI/CD pipelines to access private GitHub
        repositories.
      - Falling back to the system-installed Git client when the token is not available. In this case, cloning relies on the
        credentials already configured in the local environment (e.g., SSH keys, credential helpers, or Git configuration).

      This dual-mode approach ensures that the cloning process works seamlessly both in automated environments (such as
      pipelines) and in local development setups.

      The plugin has one goal: build-truststores.

      The plugin respects the Maven offline mode (-o, --offline).
    features:
      - Reads certificates from Git or local directories and adds them to environment-specific truststores
      - Supports authentication via personal access token or local Git credentials
      - Respects Maven offline mode for local usage
